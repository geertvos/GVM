This is a very minimal compiler and interpreter for a Javascript like functional programming language that is called GScript. 

Inlcude Antlr-3.3-all.jar to make the project compile and run. 

If I have time a pom will be added and the project will be split modules.

For now this project is as it was made somewhere around 2010.
